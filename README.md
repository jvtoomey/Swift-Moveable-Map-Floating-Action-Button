# Swift-Moveable-Map-Floating-Action-Button
I always found the Google Maps and Apple Maps iOS apps so cluttered. It also bothered me that you cannot move the floating action button to the left side. Being left-handed, I find it more reachable with my thumb there.

The other problem is the cluttered appearance of so many buttons up the side panel.

I came up with this solution for my app ShareTheres. You can swipe the buttons left and right, plus swipe them up and down. They hide behind each other, with just a little bit peeking out so you can see that it's there. 

I'm trying to keep with Don Norman's philosophy here, so enough is visible that you know it's there, as opposed to completely hiding the buttons, which requires you to know they're hiding there.

I find the swiping very smooth and works great. I was worried that I'd have constant accidental taps on the buttons when I was trying to swipe, but it doesn't happen at all. The iPhone is designed very well in this regard, so it consistently (and correctly) distinguishes between a tap on a a button and a swipe.

Here's how it looks in action:
